    <h1>Bobbie Simpson for Gateway</h1>
<p>My name is Bobbie Simpson, and I am excited to run for school board Trustee. I am a Gateway parent and I love learning. I am also studying to become a registered nurse.</p>
<p>I want to bring the focus back to education and how we can do our best for the children. As a parent of neurodiverse children, I see the struggles both parents and students face. Not everyone learns the same way and it is important to connect with students in ways that best help them absorb knowledge.</p>
<p>Our children deserve to feel respected, included, and safe. Without those, they cannot learn, or grow. People deserve respect, no matter who they are. School should be an enriching experience and I would love to see students excited to go to school every day. </p>
<p>I believe Gateway is headed in the right direction and I look forward to the opportunity to work with Gateway's excellent educators, leadership, families, and the community to lead Gateway in continuing to be the best it can be.</p>
<p>Our future lies with the children of today; an investment in a quality educational experience is an investment in a better future. </p>
